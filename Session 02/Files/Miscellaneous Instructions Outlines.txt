- String Operations Instructions : 
      MOVS = Moves a string of bytes or words from one location to another "From ESI TO EDI And INC The Two Regs" "Work With Byte Or Word Or DW.
      SCAS = Scans a string, typically used to search for a specific byte or word within a string "Work With EDI , EAX" "Work With Byte Or Word Or DW". 
      STOS = Stores a byte or word in a destination, commonly used for initializing or filling memory "Work With EDI , EAX" "Work With Byte Or Word Or DW".
      REP = Repeat prefix, used with MOVS, SCAS, or STOS to repeat the operation multiple times "REPZ,REPNZ,REPE,REPNE".

- Miscellaneous Instructions : 
      CLD = Clear direction flag, ensures forward processing for string operations
      STD = Set direction flag, ensures backward processing.
      STC = Set the carry flag.
      CLC = Clear the carry flag.
      CMC = Complement the carry flag (invert it).
      NOP = No operation, does nothing and simply passes to the next instruction.   "XCHG EAX EAX" 
      CPUID = Return Info About CPU And Arch "Depended On EAX Value" "80000001H"
